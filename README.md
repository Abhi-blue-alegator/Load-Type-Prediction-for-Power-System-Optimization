# Load Type Prediction for Power System Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the load type of a power system. The project involves the development of a predictive model using historical data to optimize power system operations. The key steps of the project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`load_data.csv`) used for training and testing the model.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for various utility functions or preprocessing steps.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks, including the main notebook `Load Type Prediction for Power System Optimization.ipynb`, which details the entire project workflow.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for navigating the repository.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as `.pyc` files or temporary files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, ensuring reproducibility.

## Usage
To reproduce the results or further explore the project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open [Load Type Prediction for Power System Optimization.ipynb](notebooks/Load%20Type%20Prediction%20for%20Power%20System%20Optimization.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to understand the project workflow, execute code cells, and analyze results.
4. Ensure that the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed. You can install them using pip:
